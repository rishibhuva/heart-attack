# heart-attack_prediction

Employed machine learning techniques to build a classification model that allows a user to input patient information - such as age, sex, and bio-metrics - and determines their likelihood of having a heart attack in the near future. By using publicly available data, utilizing supervised machine learning and gradient-boosting random forest algorithms, and creating an accessible user interface, we are able to create an effective and accurate tool that can educate patients regarding their predisposition to heart disease and provide valuable visualizations to understand the predictions.
